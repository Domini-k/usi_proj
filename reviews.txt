A fun movie for sports loving families - but more fun for the kids than the adults. Kevin James is fantastic, but it isnt enough to completely save this.

Predictable and insincere, but its greatest mistake is the lack of a fun factor to make all the familiarity feel less arduous to sit through.

Home Team somehow wants to be both a heartwarming story of personal redemption and your average, run-of-the mill underdog sports story, but thats a laughable prospect.

Because this is a kids movie, the toilet bowl humor is in balance with the lessons learned. The Happy Madison Players are also here for bench help.

Eternals is far from perfect, but it pushes the MCU into promising new territory....it feels like an amalgam of what Marvel does best - splendidly chaotic fight scenes, dazzling special effects, and stories that speak to who we are as human beings.

Eternals makes for an alienating first watch. ... Dig a little deeper, however, and this behemoth of a superhero flick has its rewards too.

Clearly, were supposed to leave the cinema filled with an urgent sense of anticipation. But all I felt was relief that the two-and-a-half hour running time had finally come to an end.

In many ways, what it means to be human is the central question that drives Eternals... But the movies dizzying star power and twisty backstories render it too clunky and overstuffed to concisely answer said central question.

Gorgeous and vacant, The Eternals is the most numbing entry in Marvels 13-year-old MCU franchise -- even as it struggles to be its weirdest and most philosophical.

Eternals, which boasts the most diverse Marvel cast to date, may not be to everybodys taste-particularly those who find comfort in tradition.
